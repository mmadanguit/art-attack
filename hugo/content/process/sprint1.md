Our team came together with a desire to see more art at Olin and create something cool and creative. This gave rise to our overarching project goal, which was to create a large-scale, impactful installation that has a well integrated system capable of generating engaging patterns of movement. We wanted to create something that could excite and last within the Olin community, and found inspiration in sculptures that change and respond to the presence of a person.
