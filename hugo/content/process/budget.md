When planning our deliverable we decided that we wanted to create the largest sculpture that we could make. We determined the two biggest blockers that we were going to run into were time and budget. To overcome the issue of budget we spent a lot of time before purchasing anything for the project figuring out the most cost effective components and implementations for each subsystem. This can be seen in our [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s7Srr3bGlSXqBPVM4ljF5UdnTTSLWI5LUlDxZ8kWttc/edit?usp=sharing)

The spreadsheet is organized into four tabs but the most important ones are the Build List and the Parts Catalogoue. We used the Build List tab to compare the price of different implementations of the deliverable. The Build List references components that are listed in the Parts Catalogoue which outlines more specific information about each component and where to buy it.

Note: We ultimately decided to go with Build B.
