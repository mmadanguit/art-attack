We spent our second sprint working on building out the wall to a 1x1 meter grid. 

## Mechanical
Our mechanical team made the decision to 3D print and laser cut all the parts, and worked on optimizing the printer settings to print as many parts as possible in shorter time. 

## Electrical
Our electrical team worked on an arduino board mount to fit and control all 3 servo controllers. They also created wires and a system for wire management. 

## Firmware
Our firmware team set up the Serial communication between Python and Arduino so that they could send individual motor commands over from Python.

## Software
Our software team set up the Rasberry Pi and worked on optimizing their body recognition program on the Rasberry Pi camera. They also started working on translating body positions into motor controls in the motor control module.
