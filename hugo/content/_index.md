# What is Tri-Wall? 
Tri-Wall is an interactive sculpture that fully integrates mechanical, electrical, firmware, and software systems. We were inspired by other artists to create a kinetic wall sculpture that responds to people standing in front of it. Our piece utilizes 16 servo motors to move a textile of crocheted fiberboard triangles. As people move in front of our sculpture, it responds based on their position.
